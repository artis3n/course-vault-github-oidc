name: Step 4, Fine-grained permissions - environments

# This step will retrieve a secret from Vault if the appropriate Environment is applied

# This workflow will succeed from any trigger as long as Vault roles are bound to the given Environments in the workflow.
# However, for the course to properly update to the next step, this workflow should be run from a manual `workflow_dispatch` from the `main` branch.
